h1. jztoc UI Framework

h2. documentation page
At the moment most of the code on the main files is documented, I do intend to write more on the wiki of this project for further reference. 
I have created an example project here at: "jztoc-examples:"https://github.com/acatl/jztoc-examples 
"wiki:"https://github.com/acatl/jztoc/wiki

h2. what it is?

*jztoc* is a set of JQuery widget classes inspired on the Adobe Flex Framework. It uses some of the very basic concepts Flex has. 

As for now it is built using the subclass JQuery plugin built by Danny Wachsstock ("extending jquery-ui widgets":http://bililite.com/blog/extending-jquery-ui-widgets/ ) for subclassing widgets.
